## Tutorial title:

Systematic data validation with the validate package


## Description 

{{Provide a paragraph with topics to be covered also mention a brief detail of
resources to deliver the tutorial online using active teaching (e.g., break out
rooms?, pair programming? shared repo?) - 2500 characters}}



Checking the quality of data is a task that pervades data analyses. It does not
matter whether you are working with raw data, cleaned data, or with the results
of an analyses. It is always important to convince yourself that  the data you
are using is fit for its intended purpose. Since it is such a common task, why
not automate it? The 'validate' package is designed for exactly this task: it
implements a domain specific language for data checking that aims to encompass
any check you might wish to perform.

In this course you will will learn to define and measure data quality in a
precise way with the validate package. We will focus on the main workflow, and
show you how you can involve domain experts directly with your work, even if
they do not know R. You will learn the main principles of data validation, both
from the point of view of organizing a data processing work flow, as well as
from a more formal perspective. You will exercise data validation tasks that
range from checking input format and types to complex checks that involve data
from multiple sources. Finally, you will learn how to follow the evolution of
data quality as it is processed using the lumberjack package.


The course will consist of hands-on work, based on a prepared tutorial that
will be published on GitHub. There will be break-out sessions with assignments
where you can discuss the materials with other course participants. The
presentations will include some  quizzes to keep things interactive, fun, and
focused.



## Motivation 

{{Why is tutorial suitable for participants of useR! 2021 ? - 2500 characters}}


This course focuses on a task that every data analyst faces all the time but
that  has received little formal attention: checking the quality of data. 

Based on solid theoretical foundations[1], the 'validate' package offers a
domain specific language to express data quality demands in a way that is
familiar to R users and easy to learn by domain experts[2-4]. The package has
proven its value in government statistical offices for several years and is
used widely outside that field as well. Learning about the main workflows and
the ideas behind the package will allow R users to introduce systematic data
quality checks into their daily routine. 

The course is suitable for useR2021 because it offers a fresh perspective on a
task that is common to data investigators from academia, government or
business. It will be taught by teachers who are seasoned in using, developing,
and teaching R, and who have been active contributors to the R community for
more than 10 years. This includes tutorials at useR!2013 and useR!2019. 

The teachers each have more than 12 years experience in teaching R, data
science, and data management. They teach at the universities of Leiden and
Utrecht (NL) and to professionals of all trades and educational levels in
government and industry. Both have extensive experience in teaching for
international audiences. 

The teachers strongly believe in active learning as an engaging technique.
This is why the course is very interactive and uses a mix of hands-on
tutorials, presentations, quizzes (kahoot or equivalent) small programming
tasks, and break-out sessions for discussion.
